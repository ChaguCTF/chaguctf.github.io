      <description>This was an interesting challange. You started by connecting with telnet to the server specified in the challenge description. Once connected, a question was asked: What is the birth year of [known cryptographer]? You had 2 seconds to react before the server disconnected you. Once you connected again, the server asked the same question but for a different person. I begun connecting over and over again to see if there was a pattern or if the selection of people was small.</description>
