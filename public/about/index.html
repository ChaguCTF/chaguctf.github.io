    <h1 id="what-is-chagu">What is ChaGU?</h1>
<p>ChaGU is a student CTF team made by students for Chalmers and Göteborg University (although we also accept students from other universities if they do not have their own team or their team is not open to them and are refered by another member of ChaGU) and some senior CTF players from teams based around Göteborg (mostly <a href="https://chalmersctf.se">ChalmersCTF</a> to which ChaGU is the spiritual succesor but also RJ45 and some independent players).</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-ctf">What is a CTF?</h1>
<p>CTF stands for capture the flag. It is a kind of competition where participants try to solve security competitions (usually finding hidden pieces of information called flags that can be exchanged for points). Their structure varies a bit but the most common one is that of a set of independent challenges where each one gives you a specific flag following a uniform format for the whole competition like CTF{this is a flag}. ChaGU participates mostly, but not only, in CTFs.</p>
<h1 id="what-competitions-does-chagu-participate-on">What competitions does ChaGU participate on?</h1>
<p>ChaGU tries to participate on student focused security competitions where their members can get their best learning experience. But like any other CTF team, ChaGU is driven by its own members and will participate on any competition their members are interested on as long as the interested members can organize the participation.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-need-to-become-a-member-of-chagu">What do I need to become a member of ChaGU?</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you are student of Chalmers or Göteborg University, just ask for it.</li>
<li>If you are not but are still a student just ask a member of ChaGU to sponsor you.</li>
<li>If you are not a student at all but have prior experience and want to share your skills with other members just ask a senior member.</li>
</ul>
<p>We try our best to keep the team open to everybody we can but keep in mind that our resources are limited and we have to be careful as some teams may not be as honorable.</p>
<h1 id="what-values-does-chagu-stand-for">What values does ChaGU stand for?</h1>
<p>ChaGU&rsquo;s first objective is trying to get their members the best learning experience possible. To that end ChaGU may decide to forfeit oficial participation on a competition if doing so will benefit its member&rsquo;s posibility to learn.</p>
<p>ChaGU&rsquo;s second objective is to compete in a fair and clean way. We do not accept any subterfuges that break the spirit of the competitions as doing so goes against the spirit of the culture on which ChaGU was founded.</p>
<p>ChaGU&rsquo;s third objective is ensuring everybody has fun participating. After all it is the fun that keeps us participating after all these years.</p>
