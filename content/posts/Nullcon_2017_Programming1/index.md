Challenge: "We unearthed this [text file](abc.txt) from one of the older servers and want to know what this is all about. Could you please analyse this and let us know your finding?" and there is a text file attached

I have a quick look at the file and I have a quick guess that its an RGB array because the 3 elemnts tuples are bounded by 255 --> FF.

I need now to guess the width and the heigth of the image because the values are stuffed in an one dimentional list. The total 3 elements tuples count were ```528601``` knowing this the dimentions are two numbers the divides this.

The devisors of this number are:
```
1   569   929   528601
```

I write my script and I have the flag!!
```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy

pixels=open("abc.txt").read()
myPixelsArray=tuple(eval(pixels))

# len(myPixelsArray)---> 528601
# 528601 divisors   ---> 569 929
myImage = Image.new("RGB", (929, 569))

myImage.putdata(myPixelsArray)

myImage.save("flag.jpg")

```

![flag](flag.jpg)
