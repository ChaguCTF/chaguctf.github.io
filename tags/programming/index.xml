Could you please analyse this and let us know your finding?&amp;rdquo; and there is a text file attached
I have a quick look at the file and I have a quick guess that its an RGB array because the 3 elemnts tuples are bounded by 255 &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; FF.
I need now to guess the width and the heigth of the image because the values are stuffed in an one dimentional list.</description></item></channel></rss>
