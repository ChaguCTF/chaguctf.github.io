Bloody Feedback Send your feedback at bloody-feedback.quals.2017.volgactf.ru DO. NOT. USE. SQLMAP Otherwise your IP will be banned The challenge basically has two functions, 1) Send feedback and 2) view the status of the sent feedback. There is also page that cotains &amp;ldquo;Top Messages&amp;rdquo; which is the feedback people send in. When you send feedback you get a token back which you can use to see if the feedback has been processed or not.</description></item><item><title>Insomni'hack teaser: Shobot (web 200)</title><link>https://chagu.org/posts/insomnihack_teaser_2017_shobot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 11:22:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://chagu.org/posts/insomnihack_teaser_2017_shobot/</guid><description>You were presented with an online store that sold robots. We didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to solve this challenge in time.
What we did correct The website had a function running that calculates a user&amp;rsquo;s trust level based on how many products he/she buys. If you tried any SQL injection in the URL parameters with low trust level, the server would detect it and lower your trust level. Once you reached the maximum trust level, you could successfully execute SQL injections.</description></item></channel></rss>
